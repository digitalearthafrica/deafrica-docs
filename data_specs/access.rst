SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common
language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily
be indexed and discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that
represents information about Earth captured in a certain space and time.

The DE Africa STAC endpoint is:
