COG
___
Most of the products in Digital Earth Africa are available as Cloud Optimised
GeoTIFF (:term:`COG`) files.

For more information on using these files, see the
`Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF <https://www.cogeo.org/>`_ site.

For using COGs on S3 with QGIS, see the tutorial `How to read a Cloud
Optimized GeoTIFF with QGIS <https://www.cogeo.org/qgis-tutorial.html>`_.


STAC
----
The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common
language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily
be indexed and discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that
represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

The DE Africa STAC endpoint is:

https://explorer.digitalearth.africa/stac/

For more information, see the
`SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs <https://stacspec.org/>`_ site.
