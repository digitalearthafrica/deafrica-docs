    "### Background\n",
    "The ESA WorldCereal project delivers a globally consistent, satellite-derived system for monitoring cropland extent, crop types, and irrigation practices. Designed for seasonal agricultural monitoring at 10-meter resolution, the system uses optical and radar data from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI, enabling high-frequency, cloud-resilient observations across diverse agro-ecological zones. The initiative builds on earlier prototyping efforts and now provides a fully open-source, harmonized processing system accessible via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key outputs include annual temporary cropland extent, seasonal crop type classifications (e.g., cereals and maize), irrigation status, and associated confidence layers. These products are available globally but are particularly relevant for regions with food security challenges, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Products are mapped using agro-ecological zones to account for regional planting calendars, and the system supports the co-creation of customized models using user-supplied in-situ reference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All maps are provided in standardized spatial grids (EPSG:4326), with versioned outputs and quality metrics validated against ground observations. The platform also includes a global reference data module, enabling the sharing, curation, and retrieval of harmonized crop ground-truth data. Ongoing improvements in model training, algorithm optimization, and atmospheric correction enhance product accuracy and usability over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive documentation—including technical manuals, user guides, Jupyter Notebooks, and training resources—is freely available to support researchers, decision-makers, and agricultural monitoring agencies worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) hosts these datasets for the African region, providing free and open access to both the data and associated tools through the DE Africa Sandbox. Below are the WorldCereal available via DE Africa."

    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a high-resolution global map of temporary cropland extent, derived from Sentinel‑1 SAR and Sentinel‑2 MSI observations. It identifies areas under active cultivation (excluding permanent crops and pastures) at 10 m spatial resolution for the year 2021. The product includes both binary classification and fractional cover (0–100%) layers, offering a consistent and harmonized baseline for agricultural monitoring and land use planning. Mapping is performed per agro-ecological zone (AEZ) to account for local phenology. The dataset supports food security assessments, agricultural statistics, and environmental research. For more details, general information is available [here](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/products/global-maps), and the Product Manual provides comprehensive technical guidance.\n",

Generated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series, the dataset captures regional cropping patterns at 10 m resolution across agro-ecological zones. Separate maps are provided for **summer and winter cropping seasons**, each accompanied by confidence layers and quality flags. Designed to support regional and national crop monitoring systems, the data are especially useful for early warning, market forecasting, and food security planning.

Developed using time-series metrics from Sentinel‑1 and Sentinel‑2, this 10 m resolution dataset helps assess water-use patterns and support sustainable water resource management. It also includes confidence levels to indicate classification certainty. This product is particularly useful for drought risk assessment, irrigation planning, and policy analysis in water-scarce regions.

Designed to support both training and validation of remote sensing models, the RDM allows users to **upload**, **download**, and **share** reference data under different accessibility levels (private, restricted, or public). This module is critical for customizing models to local contexts and enhancing mapping accuracy through user-contributed ground truth.
