    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa continental Water Bodies Monitoring Service identifies over X water bodies from over three decades of satellite observations. This service maps persistent water bodies and their associated water surface area change over time. Mapped water bodies may include, but are not limited to, lakes, man-made reservoirs, wetlands, and segments of some river systems.\n",
    " \n",
    "On a local, regional, and continental scale, this service helps improve our understanding of surface water dynamics, water availability and the impact of change over time. This service can be used by environmental monitoring agencies (including government departments), water resource management authorities, managers of national parks, and the agricultural and pastoral sector. Additionally, this service can be used for the monitoring of lakes and dams, including water bodies in remote areas."

    "#### Update frequency\n",
    "DE Africa Water Bodies Locations is currently generated as a one-off product from the DE Africa Water Observations from Space Alltime Statistics.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Inaccuracies and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing water bodies\n",
    "There are a few factors why a water body might be missing from this service.\n",
    "* **It might be too small:** DE Africa Water Bodies only maps water bodies larger than 4,500m2 (5 Landsat pixels).\n",
    "* **It might not be wet enough:** DE Africa Water Bodies only maps water bodies that have been observed as wet 10% of the time between 1987 to 2021. If a water body fills infrequently, it may not meet this threshold.\n",
    "* **The waterbody might have too much vegetation surrounding it:** the DE Africa Water Observations classifier that determines where water is observed does not work well where water is mixed with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river or a wetland), the classifier will not see this as water and the water body may not be mapped.\n",
    "* **The water in the water body does not look like water:** dense sediment-filled water is often misclassified as land.\n",
    "* **The water body might be new:** newly constructed/formed water bodies will not be included in this service as they will not have been observed as wet at least 10% of the time between 1987 to 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing river segments\n",
    "The DE Africa Water Observations Classifier that determines where water is observed does not work well where water is combined with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river), the classifier will not see this as water, and the waterbody will be cut short, even though the river continues along underneath the vegetation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Landsat satellite data on which this dataset is based has a pixel resolution of 30 metres by 30 metres. A pixel will only be classified as water where the pixel is almost entirely made up of water. For example, where rivers narrow or contain large sandbanks the pixel will incorporate these other signatures, and not be classified as water. Both of these factors mean that rivers are not seen as continuous features throughout DE Africa Water Bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Incomplete water bodies extent\n",
    "Some of the waterbody polygons contain holes or are quite irregularly shaped. This is caused by the DE Africa Water Observations classifier not seeing these ‘missing bits’ as water frequently enough, and so they are excluded. Additionally the DE Africa Water Observations classifier that determines where water is observed does not work well where water is combined with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river or a wetland), the classifier will not see this as water and the resulting mapped waterbody may be patchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water bodies fused instead of being separate\n",
    "DE Arica Water Bodies polygons are mapped using water classified pixels. If a pixel is predominantly water, it will be mapped as water. Small levees or roads between adjacent water bodies will not necessarily separate the mapped water bodies if they are not large enough to influence the total make up of their pixel. This means that some separate water bodies are mapped as a single waterbody within DE Africa Water Bodies.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### Mapping flooded areas\n",
    "By design, we have excluded locations where water is seen only during extreme flood events. A wetness threshold of 10% was applied to the data, meaning that only water bodies observed as wet at least 10% of the time between 1987 and 2021 have been included. This threshold was determined to be sensitive enough to capture the locations of persistent water bodies, but not so sensitive as to pick up too many false positives like flood irrigation, flood events or soggy areas in the landscape."

Short or missing time series can result from frequent cloud cover, misclassification, or other processing issues.

Cloud cover leading to invalid data can be a particular problem in coastal regions.\n",

    "##### Dealing with cloud cover\n",
    "Data used within DE Africa Water Bodies is cloud masked. When a significant fraction of a water body is not observed, due to cloud cover or missing data, estimation of wet area as a percentage of total area is not reliable. Therefore, the wet and dry percentages are not calculated when less than 90% of the total water body is observed on any one day.\n",

    "##### Irregularly spaced time series\n",
    "Landsat satellites do not observe all of Africa at the same time. The dates of satellite observations are dependent on the date that the satellite observed that water body. Currently, the Landsat satellites take 8 days to collect data across Africa, with different locations being collected on different days within that 8 days. This means that the date stamps of each time series are not common across all water bodies.\n",

    "#### Limitations\n",
    "This service does not differentiate between water sources, whether the water is from a natural or artificial water supply\n",
    "This service does not measure the volume of water in any waterbody. This tool detects the wet surface area of a waterbody. The wet surface area does not necessarily correlate to the volume of water in a storage. For example, a waterbody can be observed as wet with just a shallow covering of water."
