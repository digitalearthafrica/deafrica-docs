    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa's NDVI climatology product represents the long-term average baseline condition of vegetation for every Landsat pixel over the African continent. Both mean and standard deviation NDVI climatologies are available for each calender month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of the product are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NDVI climatologies were developed using harmonized Landsat 5,7,and 8 satellite imagery.\n",
    "* Mean and standard deviation NDVI climatologies are produced for each calender month, using a temporal baseline period from 1984-2020 (inclusive)\n",
    "* Datasets have a spatial resolution of 30 metres\n",
    "\n",
    "The product contains 36 measurements, across three categories of data (12 measurements within each category, one for each month):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `mean_<month>`: These measurements show the mean NDVI calculated from all available NDVI data from 1984-2020 for the given month.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * `stddev_<month>`: These measurements show the standard deviation of NDVI values of all available NDVI data from 1984-2020 for the given month.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * `count_<month>`: These measaurements show the number of clear observations that go into creating the mean and standard deviation measurements.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "> **Important Note:** Due to the inconsistent data availability of Landsat 5 over equatorial Africa, and due to persistent cloud coverage over these same regions, the quality of the long-term NDVI baseline is poor in equatorial Africa.  <ins>We recommend not using the product in locations where the clear obervation count is less than ~30 observations</ins>.  Below this, the standard deviation layers are prone to data artefacts owing to temporal smoothing operations performing poorly on sparse datasets, and residual cloudy pixels not being sufficiently 'averaged out' by a decent volume of input data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/blob/main/Datasets/NDVI_Climatology.ipynb) which demonstrates loading and using this dataset in the Sandbox is also available."

    "\n",
    "Landsat satellites have the longest temporal record of Earth Observation data, covering nearly four decades and including landsat 5, 7 and 8 (and now Landsat 9). Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series, but Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration over the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +), and Landsat 5's ETM. The different qualities of the sensors can result in discontinuities when concatenating NDVI time-series across different sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To harmonize the different generations of Landsat sensors, 10,000 60 x 60m polygons were randomly disributed across the continent. At each sample location, a four year time series (2013-2016) of cloud-masked Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images were loaded, and coincident Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 NDVI observations were retained. Coincident is defined here as acquisitions taken within two days of each other. In total, 35,189 coincident pixel obervations were collected (all pixels within the 60 x 60m polygons were kept).\n",
