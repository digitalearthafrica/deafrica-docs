-------------------------
Analysis Ready Data
-------------------------

Our Analysis Ready Data (ARD) collections are foundational datasets processed for immediate analysis.

- **Landsat ARD**  
  Surface reflectance and surface temperature products from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, prepared to Analysis Ready Data standards for Africa.  
  :doc:`landsat_ard`

- **Sentinel-2 ARD**  
  Multi-spectral surface reflectance imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellites, processed for cloud, shadow, and terrain correction.  
  :doc:`sentinel_2_ard`

- **NBAR (Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance)**  
  Landsat-based reflectance corrected for angular effects, useful for time-series analysis.  
  :doc:`nbar`

-------------------------
Thematic Products
-------------------------

These products deliver insights for specific domains such as land cover, vegetation, and water resources.

- **Fractional Cover**  
  Estimates of green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare soil fractions for each pixel across Africa.  
  :doc:`fractional_cover`

- **Cropland Extent**  
  Maps of cropland areas derived from Earth observation time series.  
  :doc:`cropland`

Water Observations
-------------------------

Data products for monitoring water across the landscape.

- **Water Observations from Space (WOFS)**  
  Historical and near real-time surface water extent maps from Landsat satellites.  
  :doc:`wofs`

- **WOFS Summary**  
  Aggregated summaries of water presence/absence across time.  
  :doc:`wofs_summary`

- **Waterbodies**  
  Delineated polygons of waterbodies in Africa, including time-series of water extent.
