Digital Earth Africa hosts a repository of Earth observation datasets
spanning continental Africa.

The input datasets, including CEOS Analysis Ready Data and
ancillary data, are used to derive output services and
can be accessed directly through the DE Africa Platform.

DE Africa also provide services which are information products
derived from input datasets. The services are co-developed with partners
and may be released at beta, provisional or operational maturity level.
An operational service is continuously updated as required input 
datasets become available. Services may be updated, based on user feedback, 
to incorporate new sensors, new algorithms and auxiliary data.
