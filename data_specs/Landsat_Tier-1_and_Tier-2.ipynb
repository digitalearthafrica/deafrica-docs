    "This tier contains all the scenes that fail to meet the Tier 1 criteria during processing.\n",
    "This failure to meet the RMSE 12 meter threshold could be due to less accurate orbital information (specific to older Landsat sensors), significant cloud cover which affects the radiometric calibration and  insufficient ground control points within the scenes."
