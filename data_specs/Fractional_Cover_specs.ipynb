    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fractional Cover (FC) service provides estimates of the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare soils for every Landsat pixel. Fractional cover provides valuable information for a range of environmental and agricultural applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* soil erosion monitoring\n",
    "* land surface process modelling\n",
    "* land management practices (e.g. crop rotation, stubble management, rangeland management)\n",
    "* vegetation studies\n",
    "* fuel load estimation\n",
    "* ecosystem modelling\n",
    "* land cover mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is developed by the [Joint Remote Sensing Research Program](https://www.jrsrp.org.au/) (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). Field data collected across Australia have been used to calibrate and validate the unmixing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DE Africa FC service has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fractional Cover, which is estimated from each Landsat scene, providing measurements from individual days.\n",
    "* Fractional Cover Annual Summary (Percentiles), which provides 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles estimated independently for the green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare soil fractions observed in each calendar year (1st of January - 31st December). \n",
    "\n",
    "While the scene based Fractional Cover can be used to study dynamic processes, the annual summaries make it easier to analyse year to year changes. The percentiles provide robust estimates of the low, median and high proportion values observed for each cover type in a year, which can be used to characterise the land cover. Before the percentile calculation, areas of water and cloud cover, as mapped in the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Feature Layer, are exluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/blob/main/Datasets/Fractional_Cover.ipynb) which demonstrates loading and using Fractional Cover in the Sandbox is also available."

    "### Accuracy estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "The bare soil, green vegetation and non-green vegetation endmembers are calculated using models linked to an intensive field sampling program that covers a wide range of Australian landscapes covering a wide variety of vegetation, soil and climate types were sampled to measure overstorey and ground cover following the procedure outlined in Muir et al (2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide an estimate of accuracy, the FC algorithm results were compared with 1565 field sites collected in Australia that were not used to train the FC model. Based on the comparison with this independent field data, the FC product has an overall Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 12%. The error margins vary for the three different layers: green RMSE: 12%, non-green RMSE: 17% and bare RMSE: 15%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to unavailability of comparable field data from Africa, we have not been able to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the FC measurements for Africa. We therefore provide the service as provisional and welcome feedback from users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of soil moisture may impact the accuracy of the FC product, and the similarity between some bare soil endmembers and non-photosynthetic vegetation endmembers can lead to model instability.  Soil types/colours that were not included in the model training data may also be error prone. Pixels that show poor model stability are flagged in the model error band, and can be omitted from further analysis if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "FC products have no water masking applied, so erroneous values for green vegetation over the water may appear. These should be ignored and can be masked out by applying the [Water Observations from Space](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Landsat_WOfS_specs.html) Feature layer. An example of masking cloud and water is available [here](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/blob/master/Datasets/Fractional_Cover.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally the sum of the three components is not equal to 100%. Differences are usually small and are not rounded in order to preserve what may be useful seasonal indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Landsat 8 OLI has different relative spectral response curves to the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. To account for this a spectral band adjustment factor is applied to the Landsat 8 data to make it more similar to reflectance as measured by Landsat 7. The adjustment factors are described in more detail in Flood (2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the same training data has been used to train both the JRSRP fractional cover product and the DE Africa fractional cover product, differences in the surface reflectance data that are used as model inputs mean that the two products are not identical.\n"

    "### Interpreting the FC annual summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The FC annual summary estimates 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles independently for the green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare soil fractions observed in each calendar year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. Because the percentiles are estimated independently for the three cover types, the 10th percentiles represent the low end of the measurements for the three covers, which may have been observed at different times of a year. Simiarly, the 90th percentiles respresent the high end of the measurements for the three covers, which may have occured at different times. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles represent low, median and high values in a distribution that are robust against outliers. These values can be used separately or combined to understand the land cover dynamics. For example, the three percentiles for the green cover fraction can serve as proxies for the minimum, typical and maximum green cover for a given year. Difference between the 10th and 90th percentiles provides an estimate of the magnitude of change within a year. A large range of values may be observed in the agricultural land for all cover types while high green cover and a small difference between 10th and 90th percentiles are expected for forest cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "A representative view of the landscape in a year can be obtained by combining the 50th percentiles, or the median values, for the three cover types.\n",
