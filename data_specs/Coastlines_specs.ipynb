    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa Coastlines is a continental dataset that includes annual shorelines and rates of coastal change along the entire African coastline from 2000 to the present. \n",
    "\n",
    "The product combines satellite data from the Digital Earth Africa program with tidal modelling to map the typical location of the coastline at mean sea level each year. The product enables trends of coastal erosion and growth to be examined annually at both a local and continental scale, and for patterns of coastal change to be mapped historically and updated regularly as data continues to be acquired. This allows current rates of coastal change to be compared with that observed in previous years or decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to map shoreline positions for each year provides valuable insights into whether changes to the coastline are the result of particular events or actions, or a process of more gradual change over time. This information can enable scientists, managers, and policy makers to assess impact from the range of drivers impacting the coastlines and potentially assist planning and forecasting for future scenarios."

    "**Annual shorelines** summarise the median (i.e. \"dominant\") position of the shoreline throughout the entire year, corrected to a consistent tide height (0 m AMSL). Annual shorelines will therefore not reflect shorter-term coastal variability, for example changes in shoreline position between low and high tide, seasonal effects, or short-lived influences of individual storms. This means that these annual shorelines will show lower variability than the true range of coastal variability observed along the African coastline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rates of change** do not assign a reason for change, and do not necessarily represent processes of coastal erosion or sea level rise. In locations undergoing rapid coastal development, the construction of new inlets or marinas may be represented as hotspots of coastline retreat, while the construction of ports or piers may be represented as hotspots of coastline growth. Rates of change points should therefore be evaluated with reference to the underlying annual coastlines and external data sources or imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rates of change statistics** may be inaccurate or invalid within complex mouthbars, or other coastal environments undergoing rapid non-linear change through time. In these regions, it is advisable to visually assess the underlying annual coastline data when interpreting rates of change to ensure these values are fit-for-purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Annual shorelines** may be less accurate in regions with complex tidal dynamics or large tidal ranges, and low-lying intertidal flats where small tidal modelling errors can lead to large horizontal offsets in coastline positions. Annual shoreline accuracy in intertidal environments may also be reduced by the influence of wet muddy substrate or intertidal vegetation, which can make it difficult to extract a single unambiguous coastline. It is anticipated that future versions of this product will show improved results due to integrating more advanced methods for waterline detection in intertidal regions, and through improvements in tidal modelling methods.Shorelines may be noisier and more difficult to interpret in regions with low availability of satellite observations caused by persistent cloud cover. In these regions it can be difficult to obtain the minimum number of clear satellite observations required to generate clean, noise-free annual shorelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In some urban locations, the spectra of bright white buildings located near the coastline may be inadvertently confused with water, causing a land-ward offset from true shoreline positions.\n",
    "* Some areas of extremely dark and persistent shadows (e.g. steep coastal cliffs) may be inadvertently mapped as water, resulting in a landward offset from true shoreline positions.\n",
    "* Some relatively small islands in the Indian Ocean are not well mapped by this technique as the number of suitable cloudless data throughout the year are insufficient to create a representative annual shoreline. \n"
