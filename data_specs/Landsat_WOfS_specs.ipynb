    "Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is a service that draws on satellite imagery to provide historical surface water observations of the whole African continent. WOfS allows users to understand the location and movement of water present in the African landscape by giving them an improved understanding of where water is usually present; where it is seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been observed by satellite. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa validation task team has many years’ of combined experience validating satellite-derived maps in different regions of Africa, and a long history of collaborating with a wide variety of stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "To validate WOfS data, the continent was divided into seven Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ). Analysts from within each regional geospatial organization labelled a large set of sample points using image interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery. Analysts applied their regional and local knowledge to help define class labels and interpret any difficult features, creating a validation dataset that is both accurate and fit for purpose. To ensure WOfS is as accurate as possible, it was validated against a range of data points. 2900 sample points were generated, covering the African continent, including the main islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, water classifiers are adept at mapping large, open water bodies &mdash; so for this exercise, water features with an area of more than 100 square kilometres were masked out. This ensured that analysis remained focused on areas that are more challenging to map, such as small water bodies with different colours, depths and surrounding environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified random sampling was then performed to select locations with different water occurrences and waterbody types. By focusing the sample on the more difficult-to-map areas, this sample scheme allowed the Digital Earth Africa team to understand the limitations of WOfS, and meant that WOfS could be compared to other available datasets. It also resulted in overall accuracy for this exercise appearing lower than expected, since the ‘easy to map’ areas had been removed from the sample design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, analysts labelled each sample point using a visual interpretation of sample points provided by online tool, Collect Earth Online (CEO). CEO allowed multiple analysts to assess points as water or non-water using satellite and aerial images. The labelled sample points were then compared with the WOfS map, determining where the WOfS map service agrees &mdash; or disagrees &mdash; with the validation dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling design is independent of the WOfS classification, so this validation dataset can be used to provide quantitive comparisons with products such as future versions of WOfS, or other existing surface water maps.\n"

    "At the AEZ level, WOfS performs outstandingly in Eastern, Sahel and Northern AEZs with more than 85% of reference water features in these zones being correctly identified as water (Figure 3, centre panel). The reliability of this classification in the Eastern zone is also very high at more than 96%; and the WOfS classification in all seven AEZ proved to be reliable, with more than 84% user accuracy (Figure 3, left panel). The Western AEZ is a challenging zone with high cloud coverage and a wet climate, 71.3% of reference water features have been correctly identified as water in WOfS product, and 97.4% of these water features are actually water.

    "During the WOfS validation assessment, a number of issues associated with input data, validation method and the WOfS algorithm were detected. The validation results should be interpreted with the following caveats: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spatial resolution:** The WOfS product is based on 30 m resolution Landsat imagery while the validation data is produced using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. WOfS has trouble in areas with mixed pixels (where a pixel covers both water and upland). These areas tend to be on edges of lakes and in wetlands where there is a mix of water and vegetation. The Sentinel-2 imagery can identify these edges at a higher resolution than the current Landsat WOfS product.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **WOfS algorithm:** A few examples highlight how WOfS misses certain water bodies. This information is critical to improving the WOfS algorithm in future iterations. In some cases, the impact can be mitigated by using a temporal summary of WOfS. A waterbody may be missed in one date of WOfS, but over the course of the year it is mapped as water in other dates and therefore mapped as a waterbody in the annual summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environmental factors:** There are some errors that are hard to correct for. Sediment, floating vegetation etc. are potentially contributing factors in this type of error by changing the colour of water and making detection hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temporal resolution:** Reference locations may have been observed on different dates by the Sentinel-2 and the Landsat satellites. If the water extent has changed between the dates, a mismatch in the classification is expected."
