    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is a service that uses satellite images to provide historical surface water observations across the African continent. WOfS enables users to understand the location and movement of inland and coastal water over time. It shows where water is usually present; where it is seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been observed by satellite. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data are generated using the WOfS classification algorithm applied to Landsat satellite images. There are three WOfS products available in the collection for the African continent, as listed below:\n",

    "| WOfS All-Time Summary| The ratio of wet to clear observations for the full time period|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __WOfS Feature Layer (WOFL):__ Individual water-classified images are called Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), and are created from the input satellite data. There is one WOFL for each satellite image processed showing the occurrence of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __WOfS Annual/All-Time Summary:__ The frequency of a pixel being classified as wet. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Total number of clear observations for each pixel: the number of observations that were clear (no cloud, cloud shadow or terrain shadow) for the selected time period. The classification algorithm then assigns these as either wet, or dry.\n",
    "    - Total number of wet observation for each pixel: the number of observations that were clear *and* wet for the selected time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WOfS summaries are calculated as the ratio of clear wet observations to total clear observations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa validation task team has many years’ of combined experience validating satellite-derived maps in different regions of Africa, and a long history of collaborating with a wide variety of stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "To validate WOfS data, the continent was divided into seven Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ). Analysts from within each regional geospatial organization labelled a large set of sample points using image interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery. Analysts applied their regional and local knowledge to help define class labels and interpret any difficult features, creating a validation dataset that is both accurate and fit for purpose. To ensure WOfS is as accurate as possible, it was validated against a range of data points. 2900 sample points were generated, covering the African continent, including the main islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, water classifiers are adept at mapping large, open water bodies - so for this exercise, water features with an area of more than 100 square kilometres were masked out. This ensured that analysis remained focused on areas that are more challenging to map, such as small water bodies with different colours, depths and surrounding environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified random sampling was then performed to select locations with different water occurrences and waterbody types. By focusing the sample on the more difficult-to-map areas, this sample scheme allowed the Digital Earth Africa team to understand the limitations of WOfS, and meant that WOfS could be compared to other available datasets. It also resulted in overall accuracy for this exercise appearing lower than expected, since the ‘easy to map’ areas had been removed from the sample design. \n",

    "Next, analysts labelled each sample point using a visual interpretation of sample points provided by online tool, Collect Earth Online (CEO). CEO allowed multiple analysts to assess points as water or non-water using satellite and aerial images. The labelled sample points were then compared with the WOfS map, determining where the WOfS map service agrees - or disagrees - with the validation dataset.  \n",

The reliability of this classification in the Eastern zone is also very high at more than 96%; and the WOfS classification in all seven AEZ proved to be reliable, with more than 84% user accuracy (Figure 3, left). The Western AEZ is a challenging zone with high cloud coverage and a wet climate, 77.5% of reference water features have been correctly identified as water in WOfS product, and 97.3% of these water features are actually water.

    "During the WOfS validation assessment, a number of issues associated with input data, validation method and the WOfS algorithm were recognized. The validation results should be interpreted with the following caveats: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spatial resolution:** The WOfS product is based on 30 m resolution Landsat imagery while the validation data is produced using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. WOfS has trouble in areas with mixed pixels (where a pixel covers both water and land). These areas tend to be on edges of lakes and in wetlands where there is a mix of water and vegetation. The Sentinel-2 imagery can identify these edges at a higher resolution than the current Landsat WOfS product.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Turbid or dark water:** The WOfS algorithm is developed to identify a diverse range of waterbodies. However, the classifier may miss dark water surfaces or water with high concentration of sediments. In some cases, the impact can be mitigated by using a temporal summary of WOfS, such as the Annual Summary or All-Time Summary. A waterbody may be missed in a single observation, but over the course of the year it is mapped as water in other dates and therefore mapped as a waterbody in the summary products. \n",

To maximize coverage, all pixels within a valid surface reflectance range (0-1) from Landsat Collection 2 are used to generate the WOFLs. When creating WOfS summaries, only WOFLs processed from Landsat Tier 1 data with good geometric accuracy are used.\n",
