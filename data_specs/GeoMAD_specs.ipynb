    "GeoMAD is the the Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) Sentinel-2 geomedian and triple Median Absolute Deviation service. It is a cloud-free composite of Sentinel-2 satellite data compiled over specific timeframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoMAD has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Geomedian\n",
    "* Median Absolute Deviations (MADs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The geomedian component combines measurements collected over the specified timeframe to produce one representative, multispectral measurement for every 10 x 10 square metre unit of the African continent. The end result is a comprehensive dataset that can be used to generate true-colour images for visual inspection of anthropogenic or natural landmarks. The full spectral dataset can be used to develop more complex algorithms. The product leverages Sentinel-2â€™s high-frequency flyovers, allowing for 70 to 140 satellite passes annually of any given location. This helps scope perpetually cloudy areas. For each pixel, invalid data is discarded, and remaining observations are mathematically summarised using the geomedian statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations between the geomedian and the individual measurements are captured by the three Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) layers. These are higher-order statistical measurements calculating variation relative to the geomedian. The MAD layers can be used on their own or together with geomedian to gain insights about the land surface and understand change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating GeoMAD over different timeframes provides a range of insights to the environment. An annual timeframe allows better correction for cloud cover and reduces artifacts for comparison over multiple years. A semiannual timeframe, for example six-month blocks, better captures seasonal variation within one year, but can also be used to compare equivalent periods from different years.\n",

    "The GeoMAD dataset has fourteen bands of data which can be subdivided as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geomedian &mdash; 10 bands:** The geomedian is calculated using ten spectral bands of Sentinel-2 data collected during the specified time period. This results in the 10-band geomedian provided by the GeoMAD service. The ten geomedian surface reflectance bands are B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B8A, B11, and B12. Surface reflectance values have been scaled between `1` and `10000` to allow for more efficient data storage as unsigned 16-bit integers (`uint16`). Note the raw Sentinel-2 product contains more bands, some of which are not used in GeoMAD.\n",

    "> The geomedian band IDs correspond to bands in the parent Sentinel-2 Level-2A data. For example, the Annual GeoMAD band `B02` contains the annual geomedian of the Sentinel-2 `B02` band.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Median Absolute Deviations (MADs) &mdash; 3 bands:** Deviations from the geomedian are quantified through median absolute deviation calculations. The GeoMAD service utilises three MADs, each stored in a separate band: Euclidean MAD (EMAD), spectral MAD (SMAD), and Bray-Curtis MAD (BCMAD). Each MAD is calculated using the same ten bands as in the geomedian. SMAD and BCMAD are normalised ratios, therefore they are unitless and their values always fall between `0` and `1`. EMAD is a function of surface reflectance but is neither a ratio nor normalised, therefore its valid value range depends on the number of bands used in the geomedian calculation &mdash; ten in GeoMAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Count &mdash; 1 band:** The number of clear satellite measurements of a pixel for that calendar year. This is around 60 to 70 for most pixels annually, but doubles at areas of overlap between scenes. \"Count\" is not incorporated in either the geomedian or MADs calculations. It is intended for metadata analysis and data validation."
