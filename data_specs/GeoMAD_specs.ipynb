    "The geomedian product combines measurements collected in each year to produce one representative, multispectral measurement for every 10 x 10 square metre unit of the African continent. The end result is a comprehensive dataset that can be used to generate true-colour images for visual inspection of anthropogenic or natural landmarks. The full spectral dataset can be used to develop more complex algorithms. The product leverages Sentinel-2â€™s high-frequency flyovers, with the annual time interval allowing for 70 to 140 satellite passes of any given location. This helps scope out perpetually cloudy areas. For each pixel, invalid data is discarded, and remaining observations are mathematically summarised using the geomedian statistic.\n",

These are higher-order statistical measurements calculating variation relative to the geomedian. The MAD layers can be used on their own or together with geomedian to gain insights about the land surface and understand change over time."
