    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa continental Waterbodies Monitoring Service identifies more than 700,000 water bodies from over three decades of satellite observations. This service maps persistent and seasonal water bodies and the change in their water surface area over time. Mapped water bodies may include, but are not limited to, lakes, ponds, man-made reservoirs, wetlands, and segments of some river systems.\n",
    " \n",
    "On a local, regional, and continental scale, this service helps improve our understanding of surface water dynamics and water availability and can be used for monitoring water bodies such as wetlands, lakes and dams in remote and/or inaccessible locations."

    "#### Update frequency\n",
    "The DE Africa Waterbodies Historical Extent product is currently generated as a one-off product from the DE Africa Water Observations from Space All-Time Summary product.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Inaccuracies and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing water bodies\n",
    "There are a few factors why a water body might be missing from this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It might be too small:** the Waterbodies Historical Extent only maps water bodies larger than 4,500m2 (5 Landsat pixels).\n",
    "* **It might not be wet enough:** the Waterbodies Historical Extent only maps water bodies that have been observed as wet 10% of the time between 1984 to 2022. If a water body fills infrequently, it may not meet this threshold.\n",
    "* **The waterbody might have too much vegetation surrounding it:** the DE Africa Water Observations from Space classifier, which determines where water is observed, does not work well where water is mixed with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river or a wetland), the classifier may not see this as water and the water body may not be mapped.\n",
    "* **The water in the water body does not look like water:** dense sediment-filled water is often misclassified as land.\n",
    "* **The water body might be new:** newly constructed/formed water bodies will not be included in this service as they will not have been observed as wet at least 10% of the time between 1984 to 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing river segments\n",
    "The DE Africa Water Observations from Space Classifier, which determines where water is observed, does not work well where water is combined with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river), the classifier may not see this as water, and the water body may be truncated, even though the river continues along underneath the vegetation.\n",
    " \n",
    "Additionally, the Water Observations from Space Feature Layers product (used to produce the Waterbodies Historical Extent product) has a pixel resolution of 30 metres by 30 metres. A pixel will only be classified as water where the pixel is almost entirely made up of water. For example, in areas where rivers narrow or contain large sandbanks, the pixel will include these other signatures and not be classified as water. Both of these factors mean that some rivers are not seen as continuous features in the Waterbodies Historical Extent product.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Incomplete water bodies extent\n",
    "Some of the Waterbodies Historical Extent polygons contain holes or are irregularly shaped. \n",
    "This is caused by the DE Africa Water Observations from Space classifier not seeing parts of the water body frequently enough; a pixel must be clearly observed at least 60 times to be included. Additionally the DE Africa Water Observations from Space classifier that determines where water is observed does not work well where water is combined with vegetation. If there is vegetation obscuring the water (like a tree leaning across a river or a wetland), the classifier may not see this as water and the resulting mapped waterbody may contain holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water bodies fused instead of being separate\n",
    "Waterbodies Historical Extent polygons are mapped using classified pixels from the Water Observations from Space Feature Layers product. If a pixel is predominantly water, it will be mapped as water. Small levees or roads between adjacent water bodies will not necessarily separate the mapped water bodies if they are not large enough to influence the total make up of their pixel. This means that some separate water bodies are mapped as a single waterbody within the Waterbodies Historical Extent.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### Mapping flooded areas\n",
    "By design, we have excluded locations where water is seen only during extreme flood events. A wetness threshold of 10% was applied to the data, meaning that only water bodies observed as wet at least 10% of the time between 1984 and 2022 have been included. This threshold was determined to be sensitive enough to capture the locations of persistent water bodies, but not so sensitive as to pick up too many false positives like flood irrigation, flood events or soggy areas in the landscape."

    "#### Update frequency\n",
    "The DE Africa Waterbodies Surface Area Change product will be updated weekly. An individual time series may not be updated with new percentage coverage measurements within the expected 16 day cadence if it was cloudy on the days the relevant data was acquired and processed. Landsat satellites do not observe all of Africa at the same time. The dates of satellite observations are dependent on the date that the satellite observed that water body.\n",
    "\n",
    "All usable observations for each water body have been included in the Surface Area Change time series for that water body. Short or missing time series can result from frequent cloud cover, misclassification, or other processing issues. If less than 85% of the total water body is observed on any one day, or more than 10% is invalid due to cloud cover or missing data, then the wet and dry percentages are not provided in the Surface Area Change time series. Cloud cover leading to invalid data can be a particular problem in coastal regions.\n",

    "#### Inaccuracies and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dealing with cloud cover\n",
    "Data used within DE Africa Waterbodies Surface Area Change product is cloud masked. When a significant fraction of a water body is not observed, due to cloud cover or missing data, estimation of wet area as a percentage of total area is not reliable. Therefore, the wet and dry percentages are not provided when less than 85% of the total water body is observed on any one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spurious measurements and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The DE Africa Waterbodies Surface Area Change product is derived from the DE Africa Water Observations from Space product. Any innaccuracies in this product will produce spurious measurements and outliers in the Surface Area Change Time Series. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples are shown in Figure 2. On the left, the circled observation in 2017 has a lower wet percentage than the previous two observations. This is because part of the water body is obscured by cloud cover, which can be seen in the corresponding Landsat true-color image and WOfS classification. On the right, the circled observation in 2019 has a much lower wet percentage than the previous two observations. This is because the WOfS algorithm has incorrectly classified much of the water body as dry, rather than wet, which can be seen in the corresponding Landsat true-color image and WOfS classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users should undertake their own analysis to investigate and remove spurious measurements and outliers from the time series as is appropriate to their use case. For example, In Figure 2, a rolling median was calculated using the previous three observations, which produces a smoothed trend that is more robust (but not completely immune) to outliers."

The wet surface area does not necessarily correlate to the volume of water in a storage. For example, a water body can be observed as wet with just a shallow covering of water."
