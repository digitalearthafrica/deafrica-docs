    "[iSDAsoil](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/) is an open access soils data resource for the African continent. Soils data can be useful for a range of applications including land suitability mapping for agriculture, soil amelioration planning (e.g. liming to address acidic soils or fertiliser to address fertility constraints), and for construction/ infrastructure planning.\n",

    "iSDA offers numerous soil variables shown in the table below. Many of the variables have four layers: mean and standard deviation at 0-20cm and 20-5cm depth. We will see through the notebook that we can bring in each variable with the Access Names e.g. 'bedrock_depth'.\n",
