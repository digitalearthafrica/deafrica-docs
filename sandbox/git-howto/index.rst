Version Control with Git
==========================

The DE Africa Sandbox can be used with the version control software **Git**. 
Git is free and open-source, and is an industry standard for maintaining code bases used by multiple users. 

The DE Africa Analysis Sandbox has integrated compatibility with Git.
Connecting your Sandbox to Git via a GitHub account is an excellent way of accessing the DE Africa analysis 
code, which uses Python in Jupyter Notebooks. It allows you to make your own changes and develop 
new analyses, without affecting existing code. 
It is also important for collaboration, as you can publish your changes
so they can be viewed, reviewed, and edited by your co-workers.

To find out more, click **Next**, or select `What is Git? <./01_what_is_git.ipynb>`_ below.

To see the extensive code available in the Sandbox for spatial analysis, see the `Notebook Gallery <../gallery.rst>`_.

When you create a DE Africa Sandbox account or use the DE Africa Sandbox, 
you agree to the `Sandbox Terms and Conditions <../termsconditions.rst>`_.
