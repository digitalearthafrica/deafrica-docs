Version Control with Git
==========================

A key strength of the DE Africa Sandbox is its compatibility with the version control software Git.
Connecting your Sandbox to Git via a Github account is an excellent way of accessing open-source 
code and making your own changes. It is also important for collaboration, as you can publish your changes
so they can be viewed and edited by your co-workers.

When you create a DE Africa Sandbox account or use the DE Africa Sandbox, 
you agree to the `Sandbox Terms and Conditions <../termsconditions.rst>`_.
