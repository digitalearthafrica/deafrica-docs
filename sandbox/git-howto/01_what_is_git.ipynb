    "The DE Africa Analysis Sandbox has integrated compatibility with Git and GitHub. Connecting your Sandbox to Git via a GitHub account is an excellent way of accessing the DE Africa analysis code, which uses Python in Jupyter Notebooks. It allows you to make your own changes and develop new analyses, without affecting existing code. It is also important for collaboration, as you can publish your changes so they can be viewed, reviewed, and edited by your co-workers."

For example, all of the DE Africa Sandbox documentation has been added to a repository called `deafrica-sandbox-notebooks`. Even if you don't have a GitHub account, you can view the files on the repo's [GitHub website](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks). To edit or suggest contributions to them, you will need to log in to GitHub. You can do this with most public repos."
