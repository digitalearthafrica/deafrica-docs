Sign in at: `sandbox.digitalearth.africa <https://sandbox.digitalearth.africa>`__

After signing in, you will be given a option of sandbox types to choose from:

  **Default:**  2 Cores, 16G Memory

You may see other options as well.
For regular users, the default environment should be enough for most of your needs.

Select **Default environment** and click **Start**.

The Sandbox will then prepare a JupyterLab environment for you; this can take
a few minutes.  You will automatically be redirected to the Sandbox environment.

The Sandbox runs completely in-browser and all necessary software is provided
as part of this environment, so no additional installation or configuration is required.


Navigate
--------

The JupyterLab interface consists of the main work area (right-hand panel), the
left sidebar (containing a file browser and other useful features), and a menu
bar along the top.

The main work area is where Jupyter notebooks will be displayed once opened. By
default, the Launcher is displayed, which allows you to open new files.

To open an existing Jupyter notebook, double-click through the folders to find a
notebook you're interested in, then double-click the notebook to
open it in the main work area. Notebooks are indicated by the ``.ipynb`` file
extension. The JupyterLab interface also supports plain text and Markdown files.
