DE Africa Sandbox Terms and Conditions
----------------------------------------

These are the terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") of your use of the 
Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) Sandbox. When you create a DE Africa 
Sandbox account or use the DE Africa Sandbox, you agree to these terms. 

The DE Africa Sandbox is part of the DE Africa suite of analysis tools, 
provided to you by Geoscience Australia. These Terms of Use therefore 
constitute an agreement between you and Geoscience Australia. 

The DE Africa Sandbox provides users opportunities to try out DE Africa 
Open Data Cube interface, experiment with DE Africa's Earth Observation 
datasets and develop proof-of-concept applications. It is not developed 
as a production environment and therefore is a volatile space that we are 
actively working with our users to improve, so please submit your feedback 
on your user experience to Helpdesk@digitalearthafrica.org.
 
**Rights** 

1. You have the right to export your files from the Sandbox at any time. 

2. You can close your account at any time by emailing the DE Africa team (Helpdesk@digitalearthafrica.org). 

3. Your files will not be intentionally shown to other users or shared with third parties. 

4. Your personal data, including your files, email address and identity will not be shared with anyone without your consent. 

5. You can view the current system status on the website `status.digitalearth.africa <https://status.digitalearth.africa/>`_.  If you are experiencing an issue with the Sandbox that is not identified on the status page, please submit this issue to Helpdesk@digitalearthafrica.org.
  
**Responsibilities**

1. You agree not to use this service to knowingly run malicious code. You agree not to exploit the platform by running applications that are not related to Earth observation data exploration. 

2. We define an account as inactive after no usage for 6 months. 

3. We reserve the right to remove the data of inactive accounts. After this data is removed, new logins will result in a fresh environment.

5. We reserve the right to change the features and datasets offered in response to user feedback and future assessments of budget and security, 

6. We reserve the right to email you at your user email address to notify you of any major changes to the infrastructure or your account.
