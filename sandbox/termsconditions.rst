DE Africa Sandbox Terms and Conditions
----------------------------------------

These are the terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") of your use of the 
Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) Sandbox. When you create a DE Africa 
Sandbox account or use the DE Africa Sandbox, you agree to these terms. 

The DE Africa Sandbox is part of the DE Africa suite of analysis tools, 
provided to you by Geoscience Australia. These Terms of Use therefore 
constitute an agreement between you and Geoscience Australia. 

The DE Africa Sandbox provides users opportunities to try out DE Africa 
Open Data Cube interface, experiment with DE Africa's Earth Observation 
datasets and develop proof-of-concept applications. It is not developed 
as a production environment and therefore is a volatile space that we are 
actively working with our users to improve, so please submit your feedback 
on your user experience to Helpdesk@digitalearthafrica.org.
 
**Rights** 

1. You have the right to export your files from the Sandbox at any time.
