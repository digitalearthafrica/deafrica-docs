    "The Sandbox also provides users with limited computing resources for interacting with and analyzing Digital Earth Africa's earth observation data. \n",
    "To use the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox, you need to open http://sandbox.digitalearth.africa/ in your browser, create an account and log in using your credentials. \n",
    "One of the limitations of the Sandbox is that carrying out an analysis over a large area like an entire country or for the entire continent of Africa can challenging even with the larger 32GB environment. Another limitation is that being a managed environment, the user is limited in how much they can customize the Sandbox.  \n",

    "Using the STAC enpoint provided, the `odc-stac` tooling gives you the ability to access Digital Earth Africa's earth observation data outside of the Sandbox in the same format, as an `xarray.Dataset`, as you would in the Analysis Sandbox.\n",
    "This is because the `odc-stac` Python library allows you to load data into an `xarray` from STAC items from a STAC catalog. An example of this is provided here: [Access Sentinel 2 Analysis Ready Data from Digital Earth Africa notebook](https://odc-stac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/stac-load-S2-deafrica.html).\n",
    "You can also use `odc-stac` to load other STAC compliant earth observation data as an `xarray.Dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `odc-stac` means that, you can set up your own custom analysis environment locally or remotely and be able access,, interact with and analyze Digital Earth Africa's earth observation data in the same format as you would in the Sandbox. "
