    "Google Drive API enables developers to integrate Google Drive functionality into applications, offering access to file storage, sharing, and synchronization capabilities. It allows users to manage files, folders, and permissions programmatically, facilitating seamless integration of cloud storage features into various software solutions. The API supports multiple programming languages and provides robust documentation, making it versatile for a wide range of applications from document management to collaborative platforms. More Information can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk)\n",

    "To connect DE Africa Notebook and other files with Google Drive API using a service account,  a `service account` is created in the Google Cloud Console, download its JSON key file, and configure permissions on both Google Drive and the service account. This approach bypasses user authentication and allows server-to-server interactions, making it suitable for automated tasks or applications where user interaction is not required. The service account JSON key is securely stored and used by Python code within Jupyter notebooks to authenticate and authorize API requests, enabling seamless integration of Google Drive functionalities directly into data science workflows without user intervention.\n",
