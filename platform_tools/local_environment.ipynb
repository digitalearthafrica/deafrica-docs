    "Directly accessing Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) data in a local environment also provides significant advantages, including the flexibility to configure compute resources on your own machine and the ability to integrate DE Africa datasets with user-generated or third-party data. Beyond the DE Africa Sandbox, users can install Python locally and run DE Africa workflows in environments such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or even Python IDLE. For more advanced applications, DE Africa workflows can also be integrated into Python-based web services such as Django or Flask, enabling the development of interactive dashboards, APIs, and decision-support tools. This approach gives users full control over package installation, storage, and processing while extending DE Africa capabilities into web and operational systems.\n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "Using DE Africa Direct Access in a local environment such as Python with Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Python IDLE provides users with flexibility beyond the Sandbox. Moreover, the integration of DE Africa workflows into Python web frameworks like Django or Flask opens up opportunities to build interactive dashboards, web applications, and decision-support tools. While certain ODC-dependent workflows may require additional setup, most DE Africa tools and functions run effectively in these environments. This versatility enables researchers, developers, and institutions to create reproducible, scalable, and operational workflows, combining DE Africa datasets with other sources to support innovation and real-world decision-making.\n",
