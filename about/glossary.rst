      workflows on the cloud and remote reading.

   DEA Notebooks
      Digital Earth Africa Notebooks, a open-source repository containing
      Jupyter Notebooks, tools and workflows for geospatial analysis with Open

   DE Africa Sandbox
      Digital Earth Africa Sandbox, a learning and analysis environment for
      getting started with DE Africa and the Open Data Cube. It includes sample data
      and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the capability of the Open Data Cube.

   FC
      Fractional Cover. Fractional Cover (FC) is a measurement that splits the landscape into
      three parts, or fractions; green (leaves, grass, and growing crops), brown (branches,
      dry grass or hay, and dead leaf litter), and bare ground (soil or rock).

   Geomedian
      Geometric median, a robust high-dimensional statistic that maintains
      relationships between spectral bands.

   Jupyter notebook
      A computational "notebook" that allows code to be run and presented alongside
      explanatory documentation, figures, scientific notation etc.

   JupyterLab
      An interactive web-based user interface for editing and running Jupyter notebooks.
      JupyterLab is used as an analysis environment on the DEAfrica Sandbox.

   Landsat
      A joint NASA/USGS program of medium resolution satellites that have been
      collecting publicly available Earth observation data continuously since 1972.

      Land Cover Classification Scheme

   MADs
      Median Absolute Deviation, used as a form of standard deviation for the geomedians.

   MODIS
      Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, a sensor on board NASA's Terra and
      Aqua satellites that collects publicly available low resolution Earth observation
      data every one to two days.

   NBAR
      Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance, where BRDF stands for Bidirectional
      reflectance distribution function.

   NBART
      Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance with terrain illumination reflectance
      correction.

   NBR
      Normalised Burn Ratio, calculated from near-infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared

      Water Observations from Space, a Digital Earth Africa product that provides
      images and data showing where water has been seen in by satellites.

   xarray
      An open source project and Python package that for working with labelled
      multi-dimensional arrays such as those returned by the Open Data Cube (ODC).

   YAML
      YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
      languages. It is used for all on disk metadata files and product
